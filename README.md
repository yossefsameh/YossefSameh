# "Heart disease diagnosis"  
## Introduction  
### simply we need to detect if someone diagnosed with heart disease or not  
### we have data for 302 patient  
### data contains sex ,age ,cp ,trestbps ,chol ,fbs ,restecg ,thalach ,exang ,oldpeak ,slope ,ca ,thal ,num(present or absent)  
## used models  
### Na√Øve Bayes model  
#### ROC : 0.9055636  
#### Sensitivity : 0.8755  
#### Specificity : 0.7564835  
### Decision tree model  
#### ROC : 0.8279528  
#### Sensitivity : 0.8094167  
#### Specificity : 0.7495604  
### Logistic Regression model  
#### ROC : 0.9063581  
#### Sensitivity : 0.86025  
#### Specificity : 0.7942857  
## notes   
### sensitivity: probability the test is positive given you have the disease  
### specificity: probability the test is negative given you do not have the disease  
### ROC: is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied
